Your discussion of effective communication is insightful and includes relevant examples. However, you could enhance this section by explicitly connecting the anecdote to the broader theoretical points about effective communication.  The negotiation and conflict resolution section is strong and you show your ability to consider multiple viewpoints (in your discussion of competition).  This section could be improved by more directly addressing the various conflict resolution strategies of Cote's article rather than focusing solely on your viewpoint. The feedback insights section is good; the example of feedback received at your internship adds a nice personal touch. The conclusion is fine but needs to more directly reflect on the key insights of the essay.
